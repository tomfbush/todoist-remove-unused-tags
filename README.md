# todoist-remove-unused-tags

## Description

This is a very badly written Python script that uses the Todoist API to remove any unused tags (which isn't possible in bulk any other way, as far as I know).

It is my first working Python code and as such is very inefficient, but I will be improving it and hope to build on it to develop some other tools that are useful when dealing with Todoist (for example for analysis, sorting, etc.).
